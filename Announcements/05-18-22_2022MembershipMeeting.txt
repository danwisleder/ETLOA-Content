A general membership meeting is planned for Saturday, July 9th, 2022 starting at 10:00 AM Mountain Time on Rainbow Drive in our community and will be an in-person meeting with a picnic to follow. The Board of Directors Meeting will be held on Sunday, June 19th at 10:00 AM Mountain Time at the Grady/Noel residence (649 EE Hill Drive), and owners are welcome to attend. You should receive your annual letter within the next week - and a copy has been posted on the website. If you don't receive your letter by the end of May, please reach out to the HOA board at board@etloa.org or contact one of the board members individually to make sure your address is correct in our files.
