A general membership meeting will be held on July 9, 2016 starting at 10:00 AM on Rainbow Drive in our
community. Election of Board members will be completed for two Board positions – a replacement for
Dennis Couture who resigned last fall and one other open position. Proposed changes to the Association
Covenants will be presented for a membership vote to approve them.
