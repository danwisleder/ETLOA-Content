A general membership meeting is planned for Saturday, July 8th, 2023 starting at 10:00 AM Mountain Time on Rainbow Drive in our community and will be an in-person meeting with a picnic to follow. The Board of Directors Meeting will be held on Sunday, June 18th at 10:00 AM Mountain Time at the Jurich residence (10013 Otelia Lane), and owners are welcome to attend. You should receive your annual letter (along with a reminder on any past years' dues owed, if applicable) this week - and a copy of the member letter has been posted on the website. If you don't receive your letter by mid-June please reach out to the HOA board at board@etloa.org or contact one of the board members individually to make sure your address is correct in our files.
